Read CLAUDE.md → parse `mol_project:`. Read `mol_project.notes_path` for recent doc decisions.

Two modes — pick from caller's request, never mix:

1. **Docstrings / API reference** — machine-readable, stable.
2. **Narrative tutorials** — written for a domain newcomer.

## Audience (fixed for both modes)

**A capable but uninitiated undergraduate** — has calculus / linear algebra / basic programming, *never seen this domain*, *zero project context*. Smart, motivated, not a peer expert.

Audience does not adapt down for "internal helpers" nor up for "advanced topics". Operationally:

- **Define every domain term on first use** ("Verlet integrator", "RDF", "thermostat", "force field", "ERI") — even if "everyone knows" it.
- **No "as is well known" / "obviously" / "trivially"** — each one owes the reader a real sentence.
- **Spell out implicit prerequisites once, link after.** Function only sensible if reader knows autograd graphs → docstring opens with one-line definition / link.
- **Symbol-before-equation, intuition-before-symbol.** No undefined symbols. No notation without prior prose explanation of *why*.
- **Expand acronyms on first use.**
- **No "see Smith 2010" as a substitute for explanation.** Citations are pointers, not load-bearing scaffolding.

Binds Mode A as tightly as Mode B. A "correct but only legible to an insider" docstring is a defect.

## Mode A — Docstring audit

Load style from `mol_project.doc.style`:

### doc.style: google

- Short one-line summary.
- Blank line.
- Sections: `Args:`, `Returns:`, `Raises:`, `Examples:`, `Attributes:`.
- Types in signature (PEP 484), not docstring prose.
- Every physical quantity has units (`energy (eV):`, not `energy:`).
- Every public symbol covered.

### doc.style: rustdoc

- `///` for items, `//!` for modules.
- Sections: `# Examples`, `# Errors`, `# Panics`, `# Safety` (if `unsafe`).
- Math: `\\[ ... \\]` display, `\\( ... \\)` inline.
- Runnable examples wherever reasonable.

### doc.style: jsdoc-tiered

Three tiers by symbol kind:

- **Full** — exported classes / top-level functions / public command/modifier classes. `@description`, `@param` typed, `@returns`, `@example`.
- **Brief** — internal helpers / private methods: one-line `/** … */`.
- **Inline** — only next to non-obvious expressions (bit-twiddling, GPU buffer math, async lifecycle edges).

Over-documenting Full tier on internal helpers = as bad as missing docs on public APIs. Flag both.

### doc.style: doxygen

- `@brief` on every public symbol.
- `@param` with units for every physical parameter.
- `@return` with units.
- `@file` + `@brief` at top of each header.
- Method docs match current implementation.
- `doxygen Doxyfile` runs without new warnings when available.

### Common audit checks (all styles)

1. Every public symbol has a docstring.
2. Every physical quantity has units (if `mol_project.science.required`).
3. Docstrings match current implementation (no stale param names, no dangling cross-refs).
4. Cross-references resolve.
5. **Audience fit.** Re-read each docstring as the audience above. Flag every undefined domain term, every "obviously"/"as is well known", every unexpanded first-use acronym, every equation with un-introduced symbols, every reference used as a substitute for explanation. 🟡 default; 🔴 if on a public symbol a new contributor hits first.
6. **Science equivalence** (if `mol_project.science.required`): when docstring contains an equation, the equation matches code's signs / units / conventions exactly. Discrepancies between docstring math and implementation = 🚨 (corrupts verification trail). Long derivations belong in narrative tutorials (Mode B), cross-linked.

Output per finding:

```
<emoji> file:line — Description
  Fix: <concrete change>
```

Emoji legend: 🚨 Critical, 🔴 High, 🟡 Medium, 🟢 Low.

## Mode B — Narrative tutorial

Before writing, collect:

1. The spec in `mol_project.specs_path`, if one exists.
2. The implementation files defining current behavior.
3. Existing user-facing docs on the topic.
4. The real example program / build target / output artifact the tutorial will reference.

If a path / target / plot / API doesn't exist, don't mention it as if it does — correct the tutorial to the codebase, or create the missing artifact as part of the task.

### Science content: mandatory two-part structure

Any documentation touching science (derivation, force field, numerical scheme, thermodynamic identity, sampling algorithm, anything `mol_project.science.required` would care about) **must** be written in two parts of equal weight:

**Part 1 — Textbook derivation.** For a reader who knows *nothing* about this topic, undergraduate prerequisites only. Self-contained. Defines every symbol before use. Derives the result from first principles (or cited starting equation). States units, sign conventions, domain of validity, conservation laws, limiting cases. Reads like a textbook chapter — *not* a project-flavored summary, *not* "see Smith 2010", *not* "we assume the reader is familiar with …". A newcomer can audit the project's science by reading Part 1 alone, no code access.

**Part 2 — Project & code.** Transitions Part 1 → implementation. Maps every Part 1 symbol to a variable / function / struct field. Names file paths. Shows how derivation equations become the implemented kernel. Discusses project-specific choices (units, integrator, cutoffs, data layout) and *why*, given Part 1.

Both parts equally important. Neither cut for length. Part 1 is **not** an appendix — it comes first, load-bearing for scientific correctness.

### Equivalence rule (the hardest one)

Part 1 and the code are two views of the same physics. **Completely equivalent**:

- Every Part 1 equation has a code counterpart; every scientific code operation justified by a Part 1 equation.
- Variable names, sign conventions, units, indexing match across parts. If code uses $-\nabla U$ for force, Part 1 defines force as $-\nabla U$ — never $\nabla U$ "with a sign flip in the code".
- Discrepancy → **fix the wrong side**. No paper-over in prose. Code right → update Part 1. Part 1 right → file finding (or fix code if task allows). Never leave doc and code disagreeing about physics.
- Approximations / discretizations introduced *only* in code (e.g. Verlet step replacing continuous ODE) → Part 2, with explicit derivation from Part 1's continuous equation.

Part 1 is a verification artifact, not decoration. A reviewer audits the science by comparing Part 1 vs code line-by-line.

### What a good tutorial looks like

Reads like a short chapter, not a generated checklist.

- Lead with problem and intuition before notation.
- Equations support the explanation; never replace it.
- Every symbol defined in prose before use.
- Prose over lists; bullets only for genuine enumeration.
- No auto-generated TOC unless asked.
- No fixed eight-part outline forced onto every tutorial.
- No fabricated end-to-end examples / plots / build targets.
- Math: standard Markdown LaTeX (`$...$` inline, `$$...$$` display). Never Doxygen `\f` markers in Markdown.
- Tie every tutorial to one concrete example reader can build/run while reading.

Non-science topics (build setup, CLI ergonomics, file layout): two-part structure does not apply — single coherent narrative.

### Accuracy rules

- Verify every file path / target / plot / API before mentioning.
- Follow current code path, not superseded design. Code evolved past design doc → tutorial follows code.
- Science topics: additionally verify Part 1 + code agree on every equation / sign / unit before declaring complete.

End with one-line summary: files written/modified, examples referenced, artifacts created. Two-part tutorials: also report the equivalence-rule check performed (which equations vs which code locations).

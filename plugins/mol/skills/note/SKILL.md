# /mol:note — Architecture Note

Read CLAUDE.md → parse `mol_project:` (`$META`).

Resolve notes path: `$META.notes_path` if set, else `.claude/notes/notes.md`. Create file + parent dir if missing.

Notes are **passive internal context** under `.claude/notes/`. Never `docs/` (public). Never `.claude/specs/` (active runtime artifacts; see `/mol:spec`). Notes outlive any single feature; specs do not.

## Procedure

### 1. Conflict check (MANDATORY — before any write)

Read notes file + `CLAUDE.md`. For new note:

- **Duplicate.** Existing note or CLAUDE.md says same thing → tell user, don't add.
- **Contradiction.** Existing rule says opposite:
  ```
  CONFLICT: new note "<X>" contradicts existing "<Y>" in {file}:{line}.
  ```
  Ask which is correct. Then:
  - Update or delete the wrong entry.
  - Wrong entry in CLAUDE.md → fix CLAUDE.md.
  - Wrong entry in notes → delete or rewrite.
- **Supersede.** New note refines/replaces older → update old in-place; do not keep both.

### 2. Scan for stale notes

Every invocation also scans existing entries:

- **Outdated.** Grep to verify note still references live code. Delete notes pointing at dead code.
- **Already promoted.** Rule fully covered by CLAUDE.md → delete the note.
- **Contradicts current code.** Flag for user.

Report any cleanup performed.

### 3. Decide placement

- Stable, proven, verified in code → write directly to CLAUDE.md. Keep CLAUDE.md as thin router (L3): large rule → write `.claude/notes/<topic>.md` + link, don't inline.
- New or evolving → write to notes file.
- Already covered → tell user, do nothing.

### 4. Write the entry

```markdown
---

## [YYYY-MM-DD] Short title

Description of the decision or correction.

**Rule**: the concrete rule to follow.
```

### 5. Promotion check

After writing, scan all notes entries. Promote any that are:

- Verified in current code (grep to confirm).
- Unchanged in recent conversation history.

Promoting = copy rule to appropriate CLAUDE.md section (or `.claude/notes/<topic>.md` page if large enough that inlining bloats CLAUDE.md past router budget), then delete from notes file.

End with one-line summary: captured, cleaned, promoted, notes file path used.

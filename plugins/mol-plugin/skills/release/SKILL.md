description: Cut a unified release of the molcrafts marketplace — bumps every plugin's `plugin.json` + matching `marketplace.json` entries (all plugins share one version), runs `/mol-plugin:check`, and prepares one local commit + tag `v<X.Y.Z>`. Does not push; pair with `/mol:push` + `/mol:pr` + `/mol:tag` to publish.

# /mol-plugin:release — Plugin Release

Cut a unified release of the molcrafts marketplace. All plugins share one version; one bump advances them all + produces one tag.

Write surface:

- `plugins/<plugin>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (`version` field) for every plugin
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (matching `version` for every plugin entry)
- one git commit + one git tag (when user opts in)

**Does not** write CHANGELOG. Release notes live on the GitHub release + `git log`.

## Procedure

### 1. Parse arguments

Form: `<bump>` ∈ `patch | minor | major`. No plugin selection — releases are unified. Wanting to ship one plugin → unified-version policy is wrong; raise as design change, don't simulate.

### 2. Confirm clean tree

`git status --porcelain` empty; else stop, ask user to commit/stash. Confirm on default branch (warn if not).

### 3. Run validation

Invoke `/mol-plugin:check`. Verdict `FIX REQUIRED` → stop (user can override with explicit confirmation).

### 4. Compute the new version

- Read shared version from any `plugin.json` (must agree; drift → § 5).
- Bump per level (semver: `0.1.3` + patch → `0.1.4`, + minor → `0.2.0`, + major → `1.0.0`).
- Record old → new.

### 5. Drift detection

Any plugin's `plugin.json` differs from others (or from its `marketplace.json` entry) → stop. Report which plugins are out of sync. User either:

- aligns by hand and re-runs, or
- asks for separate "drift fix" commit, then re-runs on aligned tree.

Never silently absorb drift.

### 6. Reach approval

Show:

- old → new shared version
- proposed commit message (`release: v<new>`)
- proposed tag (`v<new>`)
- list of plugins being advanced (visibility only)

Wait for go-ahead.

### 7. Apply

**Switch to a release branch first.** Release commit + tag live on `release/v<new>`, not `master`:

- `/mol:push` refuses to push the default branch from a fork.
- Master stays untouched until PR merges; botched release = deletable branch.

```
git switch -c release/v<new>
```

`release/v<new>` already exists locally → stop. User deletes (`git branch -D release/v<new>`) and re-runs.

For every plugin under `plugins/`:

- write `plugin.json` with new version
- update entry in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` with same new version

Stage:

```
git add plugins/*/.claude-plugin/plugin.json
git add .claude-plugin/marketplace.json
```

Run `/mol:ship commit`. **BLOCK** → stop and surface blocker. **PROCEED** → commit + tag (skill provides its own message; does not delegate to `/mol:commit`):

```
git commit -m "release: v<new>"
git tag v<new>
```

One commit, one tag, on `release/v<new>`. Master untouched. **Do not push** — publish phase is § 8.

### 8. Report

One-line summary: `released v0.1.1 → v0.1.2 (tag v0.1.2, N plugins advanced)`

Print **publish sequence** (order is load-bearing):

```
Next steps to publish v<new>:

  (you are on release/v<new>; master is untouched)

  1. /mol:push                 # push release/v<new> to origin (fork)
  2. /mol:pr                   # open PR origin → upstream/master
  3. (wait for PR to merge into upstream/master)
  4. /mol:tag                  # push the tag — refuses if step 3
                               # hasn't happened (orphan-tag guard)
  5. cleanup:
       git switch master
       git pull upstream master
       git branch -d release/v<new>

A note on merge style for step 3: a *merge-commit* style merge
preserves your local tag's commit SHA, so step 4 just works. A
*squash* or *rebase* merge produces a different SHA on
upstream/master, making the local tag orphan; /mol:tag's
orphan-tag guard detects this and prints a retag recovery path.
Pick merge-commit style if you can.

Why both halves: the marketplace.json version bump lives in the
release *commit*. If you only push the tag, the release tarball
is correct, but marketplace.json on upstream's default branch
still shows the old version, so users browsing the registry see
the previous release. The branch-merge half is what makes the new
version visible; the tag-push half is what triggers the GitHub
Actions release workflow.
```

Single-remote layouts (no `upstream`) collapse 1–3 to one `git push` to the canonical default branch (still from `release/v<new>`, then fast-forward master locally); two phases (branch then tag) still apply.

## Guardrails

- **Do not** push to a remote.
- **Do not** force-overwrite an existing tag. `v<new>` already exists → stop.
- **Do not** create or modify any CHANGELOG file.
- **Do not** release if `/mol-plugin:check` reports `FIX REQUIRED` without explicit user override.
- **Do not** advance a subset of plugins.

## Idempotency

Same version twice = error (tag collision stops run). Redo a botched release → user deletes the tag manually (locally + remotely) and re-runs; this skill does not delete tags.

Run reaching approval gate + rejected → tree exactly as found. No file writes before approval.
